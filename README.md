# MemoriseQuran

This is android application to help users memorise the Qur'an, current features implemented are:

 - Verse Order Test (users must select the next verse from a choice of 4)
 - Word Order Test (same as verse order but the user must do so for each word in each verse)
 - View Progress
 
 
 Data is collected  from Verse Order Test and stored in the local database, data can be viewed in the View Progress section.
 
 Changes needed
 
 - UI Rewrite
 - Collect data from all test mechanisms.
